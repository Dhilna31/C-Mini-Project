🎵 Music Playlist – Console Based Mini Project in C

A simple and interactive console-based Music Playlist application written in C language.
This project demonstrates the use of structures, dynamic memory, linked lists/arrays, file handling (optional), and menu-driven programming.

📌 Features

✔️ Add a new song to the playlist
✔️ Display all songs in the playlist
✔️ Search for a song by name
✔️ Delete a song from the playlist
✔️ Play the next / previous song (if implemented)
✔️ Exit the application

🛠️ Technologies Used

C Programming

GCC Compiler

Linked Lists / Arrays (depending on your implementation)

Standard Input/Output (stdio.h)

How It Works

The program uses a menu-driven approach.

Users can perform actions like adding, viewing, or deleting songs.

Songs are stored using structures (and linked lists if used).

The menu repeats until the user chooses Exit.
